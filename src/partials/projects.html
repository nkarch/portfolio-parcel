        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <p>Things I've worked on in recent years. Some as a freelancer and some as an employee of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/weareintersect/">Intersect</a> (RIP ðŸ˜¢). A few of them may have since been rebuilt or removed from the internet, but I've included screenshots and links to archive.org captures where available.</p>

        <h3>With Intersect</h3>

            <each loop="project in projects.intersect">
                <if condition="project.title">
                    <include src="./partials/project.html" locals="{project}"></include>
                </if>
            </each>
        </div>
