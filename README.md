# Nick Karch Portfolio Site (Parcel Version)

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
Run `npm run start` to start dev environment
Run `npm run build` to build `dist/` directory

Don't use `parcel serve` in any script - for some reason it compiles and subsequently alters paths in the HTML.

Default Parcel config has been overridden in `package.json` and `.parcelrc` with some settings requiring the addition of plugins.
